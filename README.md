# Assal
Once part of a massive colonisation plan, now its just a shell of its former self. Nature has taken over, manmade structures have fallen into disrepair, and you're here to pick apart what hasn't already. Good luck.

## Stats:
- Roughly ~600m² of playable area (1 km² total size).
- One main entrance.
- 4 fire exits.
- Hedge "maze".
- A working ladder with a broken icon.
